            "Wanderer Lost, gentle ocean, stones turned." This narrative is meant to engage the user in a trip through the ocean as a surfer.
            I orginally wanted to make a journey through the forest but the interactive elements of nature that I wanted to implement for that 
            story would be beyond the capacity of p5.js. So I decided to alter my storyline and make a game of a surfer who is surfing at sunset 
            who must avoid rocks and sharks as he surfs along the wave. I am also going to add a kelp forest instead of a tree forest at the footer-bottom
            to stay in keeping with my original idea although it has now changed.
